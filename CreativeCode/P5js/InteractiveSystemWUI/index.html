    <h2>Intent and Process</h2>
    <p>For this project, I would like to further develop my solar system to make it object-oriented 
      so the planets can interact with each other and modified by a user. </p>
    <p>I first want the planets to be made based on whether a mouse is pressed by a user: a planet 
      will be made by each click.</p>
    <p>I then want user to be able to use the slide to modify the gravity (pulling force) of the sun
      so that the orbiting speed will slow down as the gravity increases accordingly.
    </p>
