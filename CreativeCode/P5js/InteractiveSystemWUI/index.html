    <h2>Intent and Process</h2>
    <p>
      For this project, I would like to <b>further develop my solar system </b>to make it <b>object-oriented</b> 
      so the planets can interact with each other and modified by a user. I do not want potential bugs,
    so this time, I am stick to the emojis to represent the planets and suns.
  </p>
    <p>
      I first want the planets to be made based on whether a mouse is pressed by a user: <b>a planet 
      will be made by each click.</b> The orbiting speed of the planet is still correlated to the size of it, 
      as bigger planets are pulled by the sun with a stronger force. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I then want user to be able to <b>use the slider to modify the gravity (pulling force) of the sun
      so that the orbiting speed will slow down as the gravity increases accordingly</b>. This allows a <b>direct
      user input</b>, where the gravity force of the sun can be modified, while <b>indirectly modifying</b> the orbiting 
      speed of the planets. As a result, I implemented a slider at the bottom, with a text under the sun to
      showcase the current gravity so that users can modify it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On top of that, I would like to add more dynamic to this sketch, with a potential way of embeding emgering
      properties in the system. My sketch calculates the distance between planets and lets users know whether if they
      are close to each other by drawing a line between them.
    </p>
    <p>
       I also add another class object: dust. Dust is a celestial object that orbits around a certain planet. Due to the
       fact that they are relatively small objects and moves around the planets with a faster speed, they are more likely
       to crush into each other. <b>I therefore implemented the dust object, where users can choose to add them onto the planets
       (direct) and watch them crush with other dusts (indirect). I believe this class demonstrate emerging properties in the system
      as well. </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Rest of my approaches were to make sure that the skecth looks <b>asthetically good and easy for users to understand so that 
      they can interact with it hassle-free</b>. The sketch will be presented below.
    </p>
