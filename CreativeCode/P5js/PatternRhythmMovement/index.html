    <h2>Sketches and Ideation</h2>

    <p>For ideation, I would like to use a 5 side polygon and make it expand both in position and radius; I will also make it change color based on radius or position.</p>

    <h2>List of Problems Encounter</h2>

    <ul class="listOfP">
      <li class="problem">Set Window width and height</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Referrd back to existing examples</li>
        </ul>
      <li class="problem">Line keeps drawing and expanding without completing any polygons</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Instead of drawing Pentagons in draw(), I set them up in the Setup() instead and push them into the pentagon list </li>
        </ul>
      <li class="problem">Stroke color very light and does not change for some reason</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Setting them up in the Setup() instead also solved this problem</li>
        </ul>
      <li class="problem">Pentagons are not rotating</li>
        <ul>
          <li>I played with the variable angle by setuping a variable called layerAngleOffset to update the angle a little bit each loop </li>
        </ul>
      <li class="problem">Applying the Animation</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Because I draw the Pentagons in the Setup() section, I applied animation in changing colors in HSB mode instead. Where I update the hue number automatically in each draw and use loops to spread the hue across the patterns.</li>
        </ul>
      <li class="problem">Positioning the Sketch in the middle of the html</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Setting the canvas to window width and height solved the problem.</li>
        </ul>
      <li class="problem">Adding Circles and Lines</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Adding circles to make the pattern more complicated in terms of pattern and rhythms.</li>
        </ul>
      <li class="problem"><u><b>Adding Sound to the Animation</b></u></li>
        <ul>
          <li>After being relatively satisfied with my sketch, I began to add sound to accompany with the movements; I refered to the 
            <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/p5/sketches/Sound:_Load_and_Play_Sound">P5js example online</a> for reference and learned 
            that you could load a file for sound playing. For adding a sound that suits my sketch, I first approached to search sound on YouTube 
            and was trying to convert them into MP3 file. Almost all the YouTube videos I found are very long and made the progress challenging. 
            Recalling from previous coding classes, I remembered that there were free resources online for coding. I explored to a 
            <a href = "https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/search/code/"></a>new website where it lists a lot of free sound assets for use. Now that finding
            a sound fits my sketch, I started to implement it. I do encountered more problems when putting it in. 
          </li>
          <li>
            After setting up the variable and load the sound MP3 file, I imagine that my sound will repeat each time the color animation plays. I put 
            <code>sound.play()</code> in the draw() function. As soon as I put it in there, all the pattern I have sketched disappeared and no sound was 
            playing when I ran the code. Being confused, I tried to move the code into Setup() function, and found the same result as well. This is confusing
            for me because I assumed that, it is reasonable for Draw() to stop working because it is running repeatively and could be stucked by keep calling the 
            play function; however, if you put the line of code into Setup() function, it should play automatically when you run the function right? 
          </li>
          <li>
            With trails and errors, I looked into the <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/p5/sketches/Sound:_Load_and_Play_Sound">P5js music playing example</a> again,
            and used the mousePressed() function to make the sound playing based on whether the mouse is clicked at the sketch. I looked further into 
            <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/p5/loadSound/">documentations and manuals for sound</a> and learned that sound playing is usually structured this way for
            functioning. Therefore, although different than I've imagined, a sound will play only when the mouse is clicked at my sketch. That being solved, now copying and pasting
            my work from P5js editing page to sketch.js, my sound code does not work and makes my sketch disappear on html page again. After spending quite sometime troubleshooting, I am 
            officially stucked and will ask Professor Maxim Safioulline for help during the class.
          </li>
          <li>
            After talking to Professor Maxim Safioulline, I learned that it was restricted on purpose, so that way users will not be bothered by sound ads or trying to find a sound 
            playing among the tabs. We can usually solve this problem by implementing a button for user to click, so that everything started running automatically once the button is clicked,
            including the sound. I found this fact facinating and was happy to learn the reason of this issue and how I can navigate through it.

      <li class="problem">Centering my ul list and scaling the width of the container</li>
        <ul>
          <li> <code> list-style-position: inside; </code></li>
          <li> <code> width: 80%;  </code></li>
          <li> <code>margin: 0 auto; </code></li>
