  <h2>Ideation</h2>
  <p>
    I love anime bands. I love plushies. When I was training the imagine ML feature with Professor
    Maxim Safioulline during the class, I pulled up one of my plushies so that the program can recognize
    my plushie as one of the items and lablled it as "plushie".
  </p>
  <p>
    So that as I was admiring my little plushie when playing with the ML model, I thought of all the other new
    plushies that I just have - a plushie collection of a rock band group from the Anime "Girls Band Cry". Thinking
    of how cute they are, I thought of making an interface design project that can show off them and demonstrate their complicated
    friend/team dynamics.

  <p>
    Here is a short plan that I drafted - some members have a unique dynamics with another, so that when they
    are found together, the program will play a clip of music videos that specifically is designed for their dynamic.
    I will train the ML model to recognize each plushie, and the combinations of the plushies, so that the ML model can be 
    used to make the project work.
