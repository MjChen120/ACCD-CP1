  <h2>Ideation</h2>
  <p>
    I love anime bands. I love plushies. When I was training the imagine ML feature with Professor
    Maxim Safioulline during the class, I pulled up one of my plushies so that the program can recognize
    my plushie as one of the items and lablled it as "plushie".
  </p>
  <p>
    So that as I was admiring my little plushie when playing with the ML model, I thought of all the other new
    plushies that I just have - a plushie collection of a rock band group from the Anime "Girls Band Cry". Thinking
    of how cute they are, I thought of making an interface design project that can show off them and demonstrate their
    complicated
    friend/team dynamics.

  </div>
  <p>
    Here is a short plan that I drafted - some members have a unique dynamics with another, so that when they
    are found together, the program will play a clip of music videos that specifically is designed for their dynamic.
    I will train the ML model to recognize each plushie, and the combinations of the plushies, so that the ML model can
    be
    used to make the project work.

  <h2>Why Do I think It is A Good Idea?</h2>
  <p>Nowadays, it is very essential for a product to stand out, espacially for Anime merchs, which has become extremly competitive
    in the market. As an artist / art product designer, I would like to use this project as my starting point to explore possible ways
   to enhance the interactive experiences of my products. "Girls Band Cry" is an very good example because it is famous in terms of the unique
  dynamics between each members of the band. I would like to practice my skills by buidling something based on that, to enrish the experiences those
 cute plushies could offer. Hence, I found this practice a good opportunity to develop my product design skill with a touch of interactive prototyping.
Here is a tiktok example of an interactive product:</p>

  <h2>Progress (Till Dec 9)</h2>
  <p>I first trained Google's Teachable Machine by identifying different class scenrios so that there are cases such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Nina</li>
    <li>Momoka</li>
    <li>Subaru</li>
    <li>Rupa</li>
    <li>Tomo</li>
    <li>Nina+Momoka</li>
    <li>Nina+Momoka+Subaru</li>
    <li>Rupa+Tomo</li>
    <li>None of the plushies/Neither</li>
  </ul>

  <p>After having the ML trained, I started with a testing to see whether if I can put a music video into the program.
    As I initially planed to have this video being played and overlapping the webcam vedio automatically once Nina and
    Momoka
    are detected to be togethor. </p>

    <img src="images/ideations2.png" alt="ideation" class="diagram">
  </div>

  <p>However, I encountered many issues: 1) p5js cannot directly play videos from a link, espacially
    Youtube, as it has complicated protections, 2) The video downloaded from YouTube is too large in size to be uploaded
    to p5js,
    making it impossible to test on p5js editor, and lastely 3) Simply have the sketch and files locally does not solve
    the problem.
  </p>

  <p>All of these make it impossible to test / make sure the program runs. Hence, I would like to change my approach - 
    instead of mp4 files, I would like to play the music while attach the YouTube link to the users so that they can check 
    it out.</p>
