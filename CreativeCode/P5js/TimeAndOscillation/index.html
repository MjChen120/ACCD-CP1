    <h2>Iterations</h2>

    <p>I want to mimic the solar system by drawing different planets to rotate somewhat randomly around the center of the canvas. 
      So first of all, I reused the original example code from our last class; however, I realized that the circles are only 
      rotating on the right.</p>
      
    <div class="sketches">
        <div class ="column">
          <img src="images/iteration1.PNG" alt="Iteration Sketch1" class="skecth">
          <img src="images/iteration1.5.PNG" alt="Iteration Sketch1.5" class="skecth">
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>I then change the assignment of angle, where angle now uses millis() * speed, so that instead of coming back and forward, 
      the circles will keep going onto the same direction.</p>

    <div class="sketches">
        <div class ="column">
          <img src="images/iteration2.PNG" alt="Iteration Sketch2" class="skecth">
          <img src="images/iteration2.5.PNG" alt="Iteration Sketch2.5" class="skecth">
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The rotations is somewhat around the center and random after I added noises, but the circles now does not have their own paths:  
      they are kind of clustering togethor. I implement a sin function for the radius of the circles, hoping that in this way they 
      would rotate around the center.
    </p>

    <div class="sketches">
        <div class ="column">
          <img src="images/iteration3.PNG" alt="Iteration Sketch2" class="skecth">
          <img src="images/iteration3.5.PNG" alt="Iteration Sketch2.5" class="skecth">
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>I fixed the orbital radius, so that instead of using trignometric function sin(), I asked Gemini for help and 
      it suggests orbital spacing and orbital speed: a stable calculation for each circle to have a fixed distance from the 
      center and with different speeds (outer planents have slower orbiting speed). Now I am closer to the solar system. I also 
      moved the closet orbiting circle more outwards, so that I can have some space for a sun in the middle.</p>

    <div class="sketches">
        <div class ="column">
          <img src="images/iteration4.PNG" alt="Iteration Sketch2" class="skecth">
          <img src="images/iteration4.5.PNG" alt="Iteration Sketch2.5" class="skecth">
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>To make this more obvious, I also add path of orbiting so that it looks more like a solier system. I also added a sun. I used the raidus 
      for both determining the diameters of the orbiting circle and used the diam for the sun. I also modified the size of the circles, and moved
      the orbiting pathway backwards so it is not on the circles (i should not draw the path the lastest). I also make the line more appreant because
      I found out that it could be very hard to see the paths when uploading it to the website.</p>

    <div class="sketches">
        <div class ="column">
          <img src="images/iteration5.PNG" alt="Iteration Sketch2" class="skecth">
          <img src="images/iteration5.5.PNG" alt="Iteration Sketch2.5" class="skecth">
          <img src="images/iteration5.8.PNG" alt="Iteration Sketch2.5" class="skecth">
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Now that the planets and sun are setup, I want to replace the shapes with planet and sun images, so that it looks like actual solar system. I want to 
      also use time function so that the sun changes a bit after awhile. I ask Gemini to replace the circles with links, so I can find all the planet and sun
      images to replace them. Now I have a solar system, yay.
