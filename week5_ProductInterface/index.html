    <h3>Concept and Ideation</h3>
    
    <p> The dashboard design I am working on is for creative freelancers to 
        manage their project, in terms of how they want to track their progress,
        deadlines, and payments of each commission/projects. </p>

    <p> Since the dashboard is a website application, I imagine the scene of users
        using it will be with their creative workspace, which usually includes a desk,
        a chair, a laptop, some stationary, and a drawing tablet.

        I drafted some sketches of how I want the scene to look like below:

    <h3>Creating Devices - first step (Week 5)</h3>
    <p> 
        I start with creating the digital devices that I planned to display the dashboard UI on.
        I first strart with the laptop. I used a cube as the base of the laptop and a cube for the 
        screen. I use insert (i) and UV editing to create the faces for keyboard, touchpad, and screen.

        I then created the drawing tablet with a similar method, using a cube as the base and inserting faces
        for the screen.

    <h3>Lighting and 3D-Model Materials</h3>
    <p>
        Having a follow-up work session in week 6, I learned how to set up lighting for my project so 
        that my dashboard design can be better showcased. Professor Maxim Safioulline also helped me 
        tremountously to adjust my lighting so it looks better.
    </p>
    <p>
        Further, struggling to built a relatively nice 3D-model, my classmate asked whether we could 
        use online resources for creating the Blender file.
        Knowing that we can use pre-existing materials for our dashboard scenarios, I am very relieved 
        so that I can use pre-built materials for a better appearance instead of struggling to create 
        everything by hand. It is a very important learning lesson to me: <b>build smarter, not harder.</b> 

    </p>

    <p>
        I used two online existing 3D-models that are shared on Sketchfab to create 
        a <a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/drawing-tablet-b8d66a4f530b4c59bb85e914b3b12428">drawing tablet</a>,
        and <a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/desk-set-f26030d09d73422f8ff270425c7c63e0">a desk set scene </a>
        with a desk, a chair, a desk lamp, a few books and a few photo frames.

    <h3>Crash Error Message and Problem Solving</h3>
    <p>
        I also encountered an issue, where I keep getting a crash error message while adding more materials and 
        trying to render then accordingly. The error consistently pops up when in a render view, making the modeling
        process challenging. I hence tried to troubleshoot it by multiple ways, where I installed the newest driver of 
        my GPU and closed other tabs for less memory usage. The apporach does not seem to make a difference, so I looked up 
        <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=why+is+my+blender+keep+crashing+when+in+render+view&oq=why+is+my+blender+keep+crashing+when+in+render+view&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyCwgAEEUYChg5GKABMgkIARAhGAoYoAEyCQgCECEYChigATIJCAMQIRgKGKABMgcIBBAhGJ8FMgcIBRAhGJ8FMgcIBhAhGI8C0gEINzI4N2owajSoAgCwAgE&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">online</a>
        and Google recommanded tring to make the file smaller but resizing the materials. 
        <br>
        I then realized that my materials are surprisingly very big compared to materials that I downloaded online. After resizing them,
        the crashing issue has been much better. Probelms have been solved.
