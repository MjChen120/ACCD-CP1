    <h1>Dashboard Design in Blender</h1>
    <h3>A documentation of working on the dashboard design in Blender.</h3>

    <h3>Concept and Ideation</h3>
    
    <p> The dashboard design I am working on is for creative freelancers to 
        manage their project, in terms of how they want to track their progress,
        deadlines, and payments of each commission/projects. </p>

    <p> Since the dashboard is a website application, I imagine the scene of users
        using it will be with their creative workspace, which usually includes a desk,
        a chair, a laptop, some stationary, and a drawing tablet.

        I drafted some sketches of how I want the scene to look like below:

    <h3>Creating Devices - first step</h3>
    <p> 
        I start with creating the digital devices that I planned to display the dashboard UI on.
        I first strart with the laptop. I used a cube as the base of the laptop and a cube for the 
        screen. I use insert (i) and UV editing to create the faces for keyboard, touchpad, and screen.

    <p>
        I then created the drawing tablet with a similar method, using a cube as the base and inserting faces
        for the screen.
