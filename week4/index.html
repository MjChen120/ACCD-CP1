    <h3>Concept and Ideation</h3>
    <p> I wanted to create a scene that is wholesome and cute, 
        meanwhile not complicated enough so that I can create 
        with low poly techniques. Here I started with a very rough
        skecth on my tablet, which I think that the 3D version of it 
        will be very cute and nice to have. </p>

    <h3>Creation of Rocks</h3>
    <p> First, I would like to start with all the rocks.
        I first imagined that I can try to combine a Ico Sphere
        and a Cube to create a rock so that the base of the rock 
        can be flat and the top can be more rounded with edgeds that
        I can modify to make them more nature. However, I got stucked,
        so that I decided to google how to create rocks in Blender.  
        <br>
        I found a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EqLyGsu3AA" target="_blank">tutorial</a> instead
        to build rocks, and I learn that I can use modifier and texture in combination
        to create a rock that looks more natural. I followed the steps in the video,
        and I created a rock that I am satisfied with. </p> 
    <img src="images/rockTut.png" alt="Rock Example with the help of Tutorial" id="rockTut" class="documentationImage">
    <br>
    <p> After I created the rock, I duplicated it to make it into
        a irregular circle on Z-axis that looks like what a hot 
        spring will have and modified them a little bit to make them look 
        natural. </p>

    <h3>Creation of Water</h3>
    <p> For the water, I created a cube with some depth to make the water more
        realistic. Then I used the same texture that I used for 
        the rock to create some waves on the surface of the water (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzuJ39b-gu4" target="_blank">reference</a>). 
        I also adjusted the transparency and color of the water to make it 
        look more realistic.
    </p>

    <p>
        By working on the water surface, I learned how to <b>divide the surface into multiple smaller parts</b>
        in order to 1) modify and apply texture to it and 2) change the shape of a cube to fit into the shape 
        of the rock circle. 
        Now that I have a relatively working water, I am also including the grass/ground 
        to see whwther all of my stuff work togethor so far.

    <h3>Rubber Duck!</h3>

    <p> I struggled with modling a 3D rubber duck. I tried to look for 
        sources online but most of them are not what I would like to have
        for my ideation. I tried to create it with lowpoly techniques, but 
        it does look a little sad and creepy. I even tried to sculpture it
        to make it looks bit better. </p>
